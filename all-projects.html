           <p>A significant number of individuals become aware of congenital heart disease only after their child's birth. According to testimonials from current users, many engage in extensive research via their phones during the journey home from the hospital. Recognizing that the majority of our users access IHH's website via mobile devices, we embraced a mobile-first approach to redesigning the website. </p>
