    <h1>Redesiging Outdated Webpages for a Non-profit</h1>

           <h2>The Client's Story</h2>
           <p>Prior to commencing our redesign, we sought to identify the prevalent issues faced by current users that required attention. Our primary focus was on enhancing community engagement, and we aimed to ensure that our redesign appeared refined yet familiar to our users, maintaining accessibility as a key priority. This data guided us in prioritizing features and determining the most effective means to represent their community.</p>

    <h2>Client Constraints</h2>
    <p>A significant number of individuals become aware of congenital heart disease only after their child's birth. According to testimonials from current users, many engage in extensive research via their phones during the journey home from the hospital. Recognizing that the majority of our users access IHH's website via mobile devices, we embraced a mobile-first approach to redesigning the website. </p>

    <h2>The Design Challenge</h2>
    <p>Revamp and modernize their existing website, maintaining their non-profit identity while improving navigation, organizing information, and facilitating easy editing for board members. </p>
    </section>

    <section class="hidden">
           <h2>Researching the Problem</h2>
           <p>Before initiating our redesign, we conducted research through surveys to pinpoint the predominant challenges encountered by existing users necessitating resolution. Our central objective was to elevate community engagement, striving to strike a balance between a polished redesign and familiarity for our users, thus upholding accessibility as a paramount concern. This data guided us in prioritizing features and determining the most effective means to represent their community.</p>

<section class="hidden">
    <h2>The Problem and Our Hypothesis</h2>
    <p>IHH site users seek a sense of community, but some lack engagement due to geographical constraints.
        Users will be able to feel more connected to the IHH community by being involved in a variety of local events and volunteer opportunities.

    <h2>Exploring Possible Solutions</h2>
    <p>Considering our research findings, community events were paramount for our users, serving as a vital connection point during their challenges. Our prototypes prioritized seamless information sharing, effortless event registration, and clear event calendars for effective planning.</p>

<h2>A/B Testing on Desktop</h2>
<p> We did the same test on desktop to see if the users would prefer the same things. What we uncovered was that for desktop, the users preferences were totally opposite. Many of our users stated that the pop up window for desktop was disorientating and distracting. They preferred to have a page dedicated to filling out their information.</p>
</section>

<section class="hidden">
    <h2> Final Design Decisions</h2>
    <p> Based on our A/B testing results, we opted to retain the pop-up form for mobile and maintain the in-page sign-up for desktop. Additionally, we introduced a dedicated button to view all events on both platforms, following positive feedback from users.</p>
